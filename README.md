# indexmaker
Web servers such as apache, nginx and so on have a function of listing web dirs but not smart.
This piece of ruby code does the same thing, no need to edit web server configuration files.
It auto generates index.html files in each dirs, and files start with . are excluded.
A firefox web browser is recommanded, as moz-icon is used to show certain file favicons.
